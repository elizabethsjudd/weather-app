# Reusable components

Business agnostic components that can be re-used across multiple different use-cases (e.g. design system-like components) and in a real-world environment should be a separate NPM package.

## Available components

* [Button](./button/README.md)
* [Card](./card/README.md)
* [Heading](./heading/README.md)
* [Input](./input/README.md)
* [Label](./label/README.md)
* [Select](./select/README.md)
* [Select Option](./select-option/README.md)

## Global features

All components support different color modes based on the user's system settings.
